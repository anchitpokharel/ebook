             Accounts payable is essentially referred to as a short-term loan for the company that has to be paid in an orderly manner to the vendors or suppliers. This amount is due for goods and services received from the vendors or suppliers that have not yet been paid for. Account payable is an invoice that has to be paid after certain period of time (for instance due in 15 days, 30 days or 45 days) depending on the type of invoice and company-supplier agreement. It is kept under current liabilities of the companyâ€™s financial record. Company can manage their financial flow and transaction efficiently with accounts payable. This benefit also allows the company to continue their business with the supplier.
